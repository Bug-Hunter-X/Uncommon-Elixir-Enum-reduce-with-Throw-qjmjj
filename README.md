This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Elixir code involving the use of `Enum.reduce` and `throw` to handle a specific condition in a list processing task. The `bug.ex` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.ex` offers a better approach using pattern matching and early termination with `Enum.each` for cleaner, more idiomatic Elixir code. This example highlights the importance of choosing the most appropriate function for the task and demonstrates a more efficient and readable solution.
